# Telecom_churn_prediction

## Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.o reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

## Business Goal

To Predict the customers who are about to churn from a telecom operator Business Objective is to predict the High Value Customers only We need to predict Churn on the basis of Action Period (Churn period data needs to be deleted after labelling) Churn would be based on Usage Requirement:

1.Churn Prediction Model.

2.Best Predictor Variables.

## Approach

1.Data Understanding & Cleaning

2.EDA

3.Derived Metrics

4.Classification models to predict Churn (Use various Models & Handle class imbalance)

5.Model Evaluation

6.Prepare Model for Predictor variables selection (Prepare multiple models & choose the best one)

7.Summarize
